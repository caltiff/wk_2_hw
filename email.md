# SuperHi Week 2 Homework

## What are these homeworks?

As part of the SuperHi course, we have put together homework projects that will be sent out each Thursday/Friday (depending on your timezone). They are totally optional, but are designed to test your skills out without video instruction, leaving you with only a set of designs and wireframes.

All the techniques and layouts used are very similar to each week’s projects, but with a few extra challenges thrown in here and there. So don’t worry if you get a bit stuck, the most important thing is to try and get into the practice of writing code out and making decisions yourself.

## Week 2 – Source

Minimal, dark and monospace is the order of the day for this week’s project, which has been designed by Sydney based graphic and digital designer Matt Vernon ([website](http://matthewvernon.co) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alwysnvr)). Matt was a student on our very first SuperHi Online course! 

The main things to think about with this design is using `max-width`s to constrain each of the image sections with their quotes. There’s also a bit of helper code in the `copy.txt` to get you up and running with the custom font used in the project.
